#A script that make use of HTML5 preview made by [Tomas Sj√∂sten](http://tomassjosten.se)
-----------------------------

With this you can let the user preview images before uploading them to the server.
---

Which means that cropping, changing image size, writing text to the image... is done when finally uploading the images.


As I'm learning jQuery I'll more than likely end up experimenting and creating plugins, why not also share them while I'm at it.
