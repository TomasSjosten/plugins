#Slideshow plugin made by [Tomas Sj√∂sten](http://tomassjosten.se)
-----------------------------

Include the main-file, slideshow.php and call the function "slideShow()" It'll automaticly find the right folder structure.
---
To add own/manipulate images, put them inside the "images" folder.


As I'm learning jQuery I'll more than likely end up experimenting and creating plugins, why not also share them while I'm at it.
