With the image class can you crop, resize, put on layer effect on images and cache images.

* Call the class from a file, e.g. "img.php"
* Make a GET-request to that file e.g. -PATH-/img.php?src=yourimage.extension

Followed by the wished result for the cached file

  * &crop-to-fit
  * &width=150
  * &height=100
  * &effect=grayscale
  * &quality=60
  * &save-as=jpg

It's easy to put more effects using PHP GD
